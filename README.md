# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview 
The analysis is to help Bobby's manager on two tasks:
1. To determine the number of retiring employees per title
2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program
The analysis is also to prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results 

1. Senior engineer, senior staff and engineer are the top 3 titles which have the highest numbers of retiring employees

2. Assistant engineer position does not have a large retiring population
3. Only 1550 people have the mentorship eligibility 
4. People have mentorship eligiblity is much less than the retiring employees

## Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis Summary 
Around 90K positions in 7 titles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact
There are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees
Additioanl queries could include:
1. Number of mentorship eligibility by title
2. Number of un-retiring people count by title which can provide insights in internal promotion
